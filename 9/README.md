# [Java 9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/) [Release Notes](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/9-relnotes-3622618.html)


## [What's new in JDK 9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/whatsnew/toc.htm#JSNEW-GUID-C23AFD78-C777-460B-8ACE-58BE5EA681F6)

### Key Changes in JDK 9

 * Java Platform Module System: Introduces a new kind of Java programing component, the module, which is a named, self-describing collection of code and data. More info at
   - [Java Platform Module System (JSR 376)](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/)
   - [JEP 261: Module System](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/261)
   - [JEP 200: The Modular JDK](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/200)
   - [JEP 220: Modular Run-Time Images](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/220) and [JEP 260: Encapsulate Most Internal APIs](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/260).
 * [JEP 223: New Version-String Scheme](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/223): Provides a simplified version-string format that helps to clearly distinguish major, minor, security, and patch update releases. The new version-string format is `$MAJOR.$MINOR.$SECURITY.$PATCH`.
 
### What’s New for the JDK 9 Installer

* Installer Enhancements for Microsoft Windows
  - Enable or Disable Web Deployment with Installer's UI.
* Installer Enhancements for macOS
  - Provides notification on next CPU availability after uninstalling the current CPU version.
  - Enhanced user experience while updating the JRE.
  
### What’s New for Tools in JDK 9

* [JEP 222: jshell: The Java Shell (Read-Eval-Print Loop)](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/222): Adds Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) functionality to the Java platform.
* [JEP 228: Add More Diagnostic Commands](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/228): Defines additional diagnostic commands to improve the ability to diagnose issues with Hotspot and the JDK.
* [JEP 231: Remove Launch-Time JRE Version Selection](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/231): Removes the ability to request a version of the JRE that is not the JRE being launched at launch time.
* [JEP 238: Multi-Release JAR Files](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/238): Extends the JAR file format to enable multiple, Java release-specific versions of class files to coexist in a single archive. A multirelease JAR (MRJAR) contains additional, versioned directories for classes and resources specific to particular Java platform releases. Specify versioned directories with the [`jar`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/jar.htm#JSWOR-GUID-51C11B76-D9F6-4BC2-A805-3C847E857867) tool's `--release` option.
* [JEP 240: Remove the JVM TI hprof Agent](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/240): Removes the hprof agent from the JDK. The hprof agent was written as demonstration code for the JVM Tool Interface and not intended to be a production tool.
* [JEP 241: Remove the jhat Tool](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/241): Removes the `jhat` tool from the JDK. The `jhat` tool was an experimental and unsupported tool added in JDK 6. It is out of date; superior heap visualizers and analyzers have been available for many years.
* [JEP 245: Validate JVM Command-Line Flag Arguments](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/245): Validates arguments to all numerical JVM command-line flags to avoid failures and instead displays an appropriate error message if they are found to be invalid.
* [JEP 247: Compile for Older Platform Versions](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/247): Enhances `javac` so that it can compile Java programs to run on selected earlier versions of the platform. When using the `-source` or `-target` options, the compiled program might accidentally use APIs that are not supported on the given target platform. The `--release` option will prevent accidental use of APIs.
* [JEP 282: jlink: The Java Linker](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/282): Assembles and optimizes a set of modules and their dependencies into a custom runtime image as defined in [JEP 220](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/220).
